# 📊 Employers Data Analysis

### 💡 Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes employee-related data to uncover key insights about salary patterns, working hours, education levels, work modes, and gender differences across occupations.  
The goal is to understand the factors influencing employees’ earnings and work trends using Excel as the main analytical tool.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
The analysis was guided by the following research questions:

1. What is the **average monthly salary** of employees by **education level**?  
2. How do **working hours** correlate with **monthly salary**?  
3. What percentage of employees work **Remote**, **Hybrid**, or **Onsite**?  
4. What is the **average salary** by **marital status** and **location**?  
5. What is the **average salary difference** between **males and females** in the same occupation?

---

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
The raw dataset was cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy:
- Removed duplicates and blank rows  
- Standardized column names and categorical entries (e.g., "Remote", "Hybrid", "Onsite")  
- Converted salary and working hour columns to numeric values  
- Corrected data formatting for date and text fields  

---

### 🧮 Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – for data cleaning, pivot analysis, and visualization  
- **Pivot Tables** – for aggregation and comparison  
- **Pivot Charts** – for interactive visuals  
- **Correlation Analysis (CORREL function)** – to measure the relationship between working hours and monthly salary  
- **Conditional Formatting** – for highlighting trends and outliers

### 📈 Key Analyses & Visualizations
Each pivot table and chart provides insights into a specific question:

1. **Average Salary by Education Level**  
   - Visual: *Column Chart*  
   - Shows how salary scales with education levels — higher degrees often correlate with higher earnings.  

2. **Working Hours vs Salary**  
   - Visual: *Scatter Chart with Trendline*  
   - Analysis: A **correlation coefficient (r)** of **0.013** was found between working hours and monthly salary, which is very close to zero.  
   - Interpretation: This means there is **virtually no relationship** between the number of hours employees work and the salary they earn. In other words, longer working hours do **not necessarily translate** to higher pay.  

3. **Work Mode Distribution**  
   - Visual: *Doughnut Chart*  
   - Highlights the share of employees working remotely, onsite, or hybrid, reflecting workplace flexibility trends.  

4. **Average Salary by Marital Status and Location**  
   - Visual: *Clustered Column Chart*  
   - Compares earnings across marital groups and geographical areas to identify possible socioeconomic trends.  

5. **Gender Salary Comparison by Occupation**  
   - Visual: *Bar Chart*  
   - Exposes salary gaps between males and females holding the same job positions.

### 🧭 Key Insights
- Education level has a **direct impact** on earning potential.  
- There is **no significant correlation** between working hours and salary (r = 0.013).  
- The **Hybrid work model** is gaining traction compared to fully onsite work.  
- Certain **locations** offer higher average salaries, possibly due to cost of living or job market dynamics.  
- There exists a noticeable **gender pay gap** in some occupations.  

---

### 📊 Dashboard Summary
A compact **Excel dashboard** titled *Salary Insight Dashboard* was created to summarize all findings visually.  
It includes KPIs such as:
- Average Salary  
- Total Employees  
- Average Working Hours  
- Work Mode Distribution  

Each visualization is designed for quick interpretation and professional presentation.
